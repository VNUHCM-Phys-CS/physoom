        <h3>What is Physoom?</h3>
        <p>Physoom is an app developed by Ngan V.T. Nguyen to aid the Physics staff at VNU-HCMUS to arrange teaching schedules more efficiently.
            The traditional method of using Excel will require a lot of time and effort to cooperate with another teacher to tighten their schedule and needs.
 With Physoom, teachers can easily input their availability and preferences, allowing the app to generate optimized schedules in a fraction of the time. This not only streamlines the process but also reduces the likelihood of scheduling conflicts.
